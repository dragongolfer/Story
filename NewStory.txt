Alright since I hate talking
about myself and telling stories
about myself, I am expecting
this to be particularly brutal. 
Anyway when I was about 
16 years old I remember 
this one time I was 
over at my friend conors 
house. And I dont remember 
a lot but I remember 
there was a lot of 
drinking involved, and this miserable 
attempt at cooking, as well 
as the fact that alcohol 
and cooking utensils id est 
knives arent exactly the best 
mix in the world. In 
fact it was actually pretty 
disasterous, but the best part 
is that we each thought 
we were soberer than the 
other, so we each made 
the same stupid and messy 
mistakes. But by far the 
biggest fuckup was when we 
were cutting carrots and were 
using this weird tool he 
had where you push down 
on the carrot and slide 
it down the length of 
the machine toward this blade 
that was supposedly contained so 
people, especially drunk people wouldnt 
cut themselves on it. So 
guess what happened? We both 
proceded to cut ourselves quite 
deeply on this machine. My 
friend was first in line, 
and as he got down 
to the base of the 
carrot proceded to slice into 
the tip of his thumb 
quite deeply, almost slicing the 
tip off. Blood got all 
over the carrot, and the 
machine so we went to 
clean everything up and continue 
making our meal. By the 
way as I am typing 
this I remembered more details 
and if I recall correctly, 
we were making chinese food 
of some kind. Anyway after 
he cut himself and we 
cleaned up and all that 
jazz I informed him that 
he was too drunk to 
use sharp things and that 
I would do the carrots. 
Well guess what? So was 
I. I was being particularly 
mindful not to cut myself 
like he did, and as 
I got down to the 
base of the carrot I 
kept focusing more and more 
on it, and then I 
done fucked up and did 
the exact same thing... I 
sliced my thumb open, and 
there was this bit of 
skin just hanging out, nbd. 
Needless to say I felt 
pretty damn stupid and after 
both of us injured ourselves 
in the exact same way, 
I concluded that maybe the 
machine wasnt as great as 
previously claimed. Though I dont 
know if the designers intended 
its use to be alcohol 
fueled, they should have expected 
that was a possibility, and 
planned accordingly. I can think 
of at least 5 different 
ways to make that device 
drunk_idiot proof. So that is 
pretty much that story. Later 
on that night though I 
dont remember whos idea this 
was but somebody had the 
brilliant idea to do the 
cinnamon challenge or whatever it 
was called. I think the 
idea is to hold a 
spoonful of cinnamon in your 
mouth as long as humanly 
possible? But I dont remember 
the exact qualifiers for that. 
Anyway we all had to 
do the challenge, but we 
didnt have cinnamon, the closest 
thing we had was hershys 
baking chocolate. That powered hershys 
chocolate stuff that is designed 
to be used for baking 
and all those projects where 
you need a lot of 
chocolate flavor. Turns out in 
its pure concentrated form it 
is the most unpleasant, reactive, 
and bitter substance I have 
ever tasted. I volunteered as 
the first to sacrifice himself 
upon the altar of experimentation 
and observation, and having seen 
the word chocolate in the 
name we all thought "This 
cant be that bad right?". 
WRONG! As soon as it 
came in contact with my 
tongue, it caused me to 
gag, which caused me to 
inhale a bit of it, 
which in turn caused me 
to start counging and I 
ended up spraying this aerosolized 
hershys baking powder all over 
the kitchen, and when I 
say all over I mean 
it carried all over the 
kitchen as it was so 
fine. It was a mess 
of egregious complexity, and I 
spent the next 10 minutes 
before cleaning up running my 
mouth under the faucet because 
it burned that bad. Oh 
I forgot that my friend 
was actually standing directly in 
my path behind the counter 
so he got himself covered 
in quasi-wet hershys baking powder. 
It really was one of 
those moemnts where if someone 
walked in the room they 
would honestly ask themselves "Da 
fuck is up with people", 
not one of my friends 
tried it after I did. 
Lolol. So I remain the 
victor of that challenge with 
a time of like .7 
seconds? Something like that. Those 
are maybe the best "PG" 
stories that I can think 
of, or at least the 
best ones where I dont 
look like a total jackass/dick. 
Im sure I have more 
that paint me in a 
less than heroic light, but 
my best stories are most 
definitely NOT "PG", some of 
them I might even go 
so far as to give 
a rating of "Not Rated", 
but I will save those 
for another time and place 
that is more apropriate than 
a school setting. God I 
cant think of enough words 
for this. What else can 
I say about my stories? 
Oh not that it actually 
matters but at least in 
these stories vs the original 
I dont look so entirely 
lame, so HA! Wow, at 
the start of wow I 
was 6 words short, now 
Im not! Lulz.
