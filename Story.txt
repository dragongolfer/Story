When I was 
about 6 or
7 years old 
my parents took 
me to disneyland 
or disney world, 
I dont know
whichever one is
in Florida, anyway
back to the
story. They took
me there along 
with my infant 
brother for a 
family vacation, you 
know normal family 
fun stuff. But 
it ended up 
being an incredibly 
scary and odd 
trip. There were 
three major events 
that happened the 
week we were 
there. First we 
were out one 
day walking through 
the park seeing 
various attractions, 
going on various 
rides, and then 
my Father came 
upon this ride 
that as I 
recall was called 
"Alien Encounter" or 
"Alien Adventure" one 
of those things 
I dont remember. 
Anyway he thought 
it would be 
fun for me 
and him to 
go on this 
ride together despite 
my mothers staunt 
objections to his 
idea. So I 
ended up going 
on this ride 
with my father. 
I went in, 
strapped into the 
seat, the lights 
went off and 
the "ride" started. 
It was very 
interactive and was 
more of a 
simulation, there was 
screaming, flashing lights, 
shaking, there was 
even a moist, 
and mist emitting 
mouth that reached
out and touched
my neck and
moved down my
shoulder. I was 
so scared and
sreaming so loud.
I was holding
onto that chair
for dear life.
When the ride
ended I ran 
out of there
screaming and crying
and ran toward
my mother and 
wrapped myself around
her legs sobbing.
She proceded to
yell at my 
father and was
furious with him
and then I
remember going back
to the hotel
room. Fun fact
that ride was
closed shortly after.

The next interesting
thing, which I
believe happened the
next day was
when we were
at the hotel
and I walked
out of the
room to go
get something from
the car. I 
get to the
car and grab
whatever it was
I was looking
for. I close
the car door
and head back
to the hotel
room door and
right as I
am walking by
a giant black
snake slithers right
past me no
more than a
foot in front
of me. I 
run screaming as
loud as I
can for the
car and lock
myself in, and
I remember thinking
that the snake
cant get in
if the doors 
are locked, which
is totally ridiculous
I know. My 
parents come running
out to the
car, and I
had the keys
and they asked
me what happened
and I'm shouting
at them through
the glass and 
I tell them
about the giant 
snake, and they
spent the next
15 to 20
minutes trying to
get me out
of the car.
They finally did
but I made
my dad carry
me back to
the room because
I thought the
snake was still
there waiting to
get me.

The third and
probably most amusing
or possibly interesting
thing that happened
while we were
in florida which
I didnt learn
about until I
was much older
is that apparently
my little sister
was concieved while 
we were staying
in disneyland. My 
mom told me
that my dad
apparently made a
bad judgement call
in regards to
the use of 
contraceptives while they
were there in 
flagrante delicto. Thus
my sister was
an accident while
me and my 
brother were both
incredibly planned children.
She was not.
As a result
we like to
call her the
disneyland surprise. A
nice little souvenier
so to speak,
and a reminder
of our time
there in florida.
For the longest
