When I was 
about 6 or
7 years old 
my parents took 
me to Disneyland 
or Disney world, 
whichever one is
in Florida. They took
me there along 
with my infant 
brother for a 
family vacation, you 
know normal family 
fun stuff. But 
it ended up 
being an incredibly 
scary and odd 
trip. There were 
three major events 
that happened the 
week we were 
there. First we 
were out one 
day walking through 
the park seeing 
various attractions, 
going on various 
rides, and then 
my Father came 
upon this ride 
that, as I 
recall, was called 
"Alien Encounter" or 
"Alien Adventure" one 
of those things 
I dont remember. 
Anyway he thought 
it would be 
fun for me 
and him to 
go on this 
ride together despite 
my mothers staunt 
objections to his 
idea. So I 
ended up going 
on this ride 
with my father. 
I went in, 
strapped into the 
seat, the lights 
turned on and 
the "ride" started. 
It was very 
interactive and was 
more of a 
simulation. There was 
screaming, flashing lights, 
shaking, and even a mist emitting 
mouth that reached
out and touched
my neck and
moved down my
shoulder. I was 
so scared and
sreaming so loud.
I was holding
onto that chair
for dear life.
When the ride
ended I ran 
out of there
screaming and crying
and ran toward
my mother and 
wrapped myself around
her legs sobbing.
She proceded to
yell at my 
father and was
furious with him
and then I
remember going back
to the hotel
room. Fun fact
that ride was
closed shortly after.

The next interesting
thing, which I
believe happened the
next day was
when we were
at the hotel
and I walked
out of the
room to go
get something from
the car. I 
get to the
car and grab
whatever it was
I was looking
for. I close
the car door
and head back
to the hotel
room door and
right as I
am walking by
a giant black
snake slithers right
past me no
more than a
foot in front
of me. I 
run screaming as
loud as I
can for the
car and lock
myself in, and
I remember thinking
that the snake
cant get in
if the doors 
are locked, which
is totally ridiculous
I know. My 
parents come running
out to the
car, and I
had the keys
and they asked
me what happened
and I'm shouting
at them through
the glass and 
I tell them
about the giant 
snake, and they
spent the next
15 to 20
minutes trying to
get me out
of the car.
They finally did
but I made
my dad carry
me back to
the room because
I thought the
snake was still
there waiting to
get me.

The third and
probably most amusing
or possibly interesting
thing that happened
while we were
in florida which
I didnt learn
about until I
was much older
is that apparently
my little sister
was concieved while 
we were staying
in disneyland. My 
mom told me
that my dad
apparently made a
bad judgement call
in regards to
the use of 
contraceptives while they
were there in 
flagrante delicto. Thus
my sister was
an accident while
me and my 
brother were both
incredibly planned children.
She was not.
As a result
we like to
call her the
disneyland surprise. A
nice little souvenier
so to speak,
and a reminder
of our time
there in florida.
For the longest
time she didnt
know that she
was an accident,
and when she
found out as
I recall she
was kind of
upset. Which might
be a bit
of an understatement,
although I think
her surprise at
that revelation outweighed
her anger about
it. She is
fine with it
now, and we
laugh and joke
about it all
the time. But
when she found
out and I 
cant emphasize this 
enough, SHE WAS
PISSED. She didnt 
speak to any 
of us for 
about a day.
When she finally
did, she was
kind of mean
for the first
day or two
after, but eventually
my parents were
able to convince
her that just
because she was
a surprise they
didnt love her
any less than
they loved me
or my brother.

When she was
an infant and
I was about
8 years old
we were in 
michigan for my
grandfathers funeral staying
at some quasi
crappy hotel that
wasnt near much.
Anyway one day 
we were in
the room and
my dad left
a scalding cup
of coffee on
the dresser with
no lid on 
it. And my
sister was playing
around, and accidently
pulled the cup
of coffee and
spilled it all
over her arm.
She got severe
burns, and they
called an ambulance
and had to
take her to 
the hospital. They
had to give
her morphine because
she was in
so much pain
and she needed
skin grafts on
her left arm.
She was fine
but she has 
scars on her
arm to this
day from that
event and she
always gives my
dad crap about
it. So does
my mom, they
use it against
him when he
is being annoying.
That is another
classic example of
my mom warning
my dad about 
something and him
not listening allowing
disaster and chaos 
to ensue. To
this day things
like this still
happen, though not
always to this
degree.
